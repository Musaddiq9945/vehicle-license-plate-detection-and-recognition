# vehicle-license-plate-detection-and-recognition
The aim of this project is for detecting vehicle licence plates in images, videos and live camera streams using YOLOv11 and recognising and extracting characters of the registration number from the detected license plate using EasyOCR.
#The dataset for training was sourced from Roboflow Universe which contains a host of datasets with annotated images very useful for various computer vision projects and workflows. The one used in this project is available at here https://universe.roboflow.com/roboflow-universe-projects/license-plate-recognition-rxg4e/dataset/11 .
